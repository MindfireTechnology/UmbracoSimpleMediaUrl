# Umbraco Simple Media URL

My least favorite part of Umbraco has always been that when you add a file in the Media Service it assigns some random number for it's path! This extension gives the media items a relative path based on the folder structure -- like you might expect.

After installation, if you add a property "localPath" (Label) to your tab then you can see the relative path the file is stored at. This is useful for popping into the properties pages and grabbing the URL.
